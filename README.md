# ShareNewsAPI
**Technologies**: FastAPI, Pydantic, Psycopg, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Postman

### Motivation and Overview of Functionality
Oftentimes we see scroll through our phones in the morning skimming through news article headlines but never have the time to thoroughly read the articles. This API not only allows users to share the URL, title, and authors of new articles that they find interesting and beneficial but also allows users to save those posts so they have time to read them later. Each post keeps count of how many users have saved that post without revealing users' identity to indicate how many people have shown interest in that article.
